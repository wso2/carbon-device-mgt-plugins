This script is used to run this service in a testing environment. It can be run on a real Raspberry Pi device or in a 
virtual environment.

To run: ` sudo ./testAgent.sh ` and follow the instructions.

                                                -------------------
                                                  startService.sh
                                                -------------------
After testing, this script can be used to deploy this application as a service on Raspberry Pi which will get loaded
during boot up process.

create a service:
        ` sudo ./startService.sh `
        
get current state of the service:
       ` sudo service RaspberryService.sh status `

start service:
       ` sudo service RaspberryService.sh start `

stop service:
       ` sudo service RaspberryService.sh stop `

restart service:
       ` sudo service RaspberryService.sh restart `
